              <p>Hello! I am a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. As I make this site I am at the senior level and majoring in Psychology. In addition to this, I am minoring in Information Science and CTD (Creative Technology and Design). Throughout my life I have always enjoyed making artwork in a variety of mediums. Recently I discovered how to make digital art and have made a sizeable portfolio to show off. Although, my work is undoubtedly amateur, I am proud of it nonetheless.</p>
              <p>In the Spring of 2021 I was able to acquire a 3D printer. Using this device I was able to print helmets from my favorite series Star Wars! One of my biggest hobbies night now is printing helmets and putting loads of time into making them appear screen accurate. This activity is by far one of my favorite things to do and I can't wait to see where it takes me! In the future, I was to make an entire suit of 'Star Warsian' armor.</p>
