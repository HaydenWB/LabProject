      <h2 id="second">Why did I take this class and what are my goals?</h2>
      <p>Last fall I took my first coding class EVER. I entered the class thinking, "This'll be
      interesting, but I can always drop the class." Instead I found the subject was right up
    my alley. I'm taking this class to get a fuller understanding of coding and how it can be
  used in a practical setting, such as making websites!</p>

      <h2 id="second">A Little Bit About Me</h2>
      <p>Well, I'm a senior psychology major in two minor programs, information science and
      CTD. With regard to my personal life, I'm an athlete, a gamer, an artist, and a total
    nerd! Star Wars means more to me than most things in the world... other than my dog.
  I'm sure there's more to me, but those have been my defining interests these past few years.</p>
