              <p>Hello! I am a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. As I make this site I am at the senior level and majoring in Psychology. In addition to this, I am minoring in Information Science and CTD (Creative Technology and Design). It has always been a dream of mine to go to Italy, so imagine my excitement when the opportunity presented itself earlier this year! Eating and dining is undoubtedly one of the greatest things Italy is known for, so let this blog be a documentation of my experiences with the food I eat while I'm here!</p>
